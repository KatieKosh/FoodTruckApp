# Lunch Box
*How do you find something that is usually moving around daily?*

We made an inviting application to map food trucks in Austin and allow users to add food trucks they find along the way.

Utilizing bootstrap to create the UI, we integrated the Google Maps API to create the map on the page with pins, and get the users current location. We used OpenWeather API to display the current and future weather information around lunch time. Finally, we used Firebase to store the food truck information. We experiemented with Vue.JS and used the [Vue Contact Form Genorator](https://icebob.gitbooks.io/vueformgenerator/content/) to get and upload user input.

### Future Considerations
We'd like to make the app more mobile friendly, and integrate the Yelp API to display more information about food trucks and gather more reviews.
